[Singer](https://www.singer.io/) tap that extracts data from a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) database and produces JSON-formatted data following the [Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md).

This is a [PipelineWise](https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise) compatible tap connector.

## How to use it

The recommended method of running this tap is to use it from [PipelineWise](https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise). When running it from PipelineWise you don't need to configure this tap with JSON files and most of things are automated. Please check the related documentation at [Tap Snowflake](https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise/connectors/taps/snowflake.html)

If you want to run this [Singer Tap](https://singer.io) independently please read further.

### Install and Run

First, make sure Python 3 is installed on your system or follow these
installation instructions for [Mac](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/) or
[Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04).

It's recommended to use a virtualenv:

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  pip install pipelinewise-tap-snowflake
```

or

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install .
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `config.json` file with connection details to snowflake.

   ```json
   {
     "account": "rtxxxxx.eu-central-1",
     "dbname": "database_name",
     "user": "my_user",
     "password": "password",
     "warehouse": "my_virtual_warehouse",
     "filter_dbs": "database_name",
     "filter_schemas": "schema1,schema2"
   }
   ```

`filter_dbs` and `filter_schemas` are optional.

2. Run it in discovery mode to generate a `properties.json`

3. Edit the `properties.json` and select the streams to replicate

4. Run the tap like any other singer compatible tap:

```
  tap-snowflake --config config.json --properties properties.json --state state.json
```

### Discovery mode

The tap can be invoked in discovery mode to find the available tables and
columns in the database:

```bash
$ tap-snowflake --config config.json --discover

```

A discovered catalog is output, with a JSON-schema description of each table. A
source table directly corresponds to a Singer stream.

## Replication methods

The two ways to replicate a given table are `FULL_TABLE` and `INCREMENTAL`.

### Full Table

Full-table replication extracts all data from the source table each time the tap
is invoked.

### Incremental

Incremental replication works in conjunction with a state file to only extract
new records each time the tap is invoked. This requires a replication key to be
specified in the table's metadata as well.
